# Using your superpower for good (when it’s convenient)

- Go to your local library to find out who is in need of help in the community and get to them
- Get a police response radio and beat them to the scene of the crime
- Post signs around the community offering your services, for free, of course
- Talk to local leaders in the community about what their top needs are
- Bring snacks to every meeting--exactly the kinds everyone wants, using your mind reading abilities
